# Moral-Machine-Learning
This is the repository that retains my homework and projects for Moral Machine learning, a new class at UNC-CH that delves into the philisophical and ethical facets of Machine learning and LLMs.

# Regarding The Final: 
STOR390Final.RMD is the working R markdown, containing the raw code of my final project
STOR390Final.pdf is the lovely knitted pdf that forced me to learn latex

## Project Description
This R Markdown document presents a comprehensive analysis of the implications of using statistical discrimination within law enforcement. The project examines the use of statistical models to predict the likelihood of criminal behavior based on various group and individual characteristics. These insights are used to assess the objectivity and efficiency of policing practices and explore the ethical concerns arising from potential biases and inaccuracies

## Data Source
The analysis is based on data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), which follows a cohort of young individuals transitioning into adulthood, collecting data on their delinquent behaviors, family and individual characteristics, and interactions with law enforcement.

## Key Libraries Used
dplyr: For data manipulation.
caret: For creating training and test datasets and modeling.
float: Assists in handling floating point numbers.
knitr and kableExtra: For creating tables and controlling their formatting in the output document.
pROC: For generating ROC curves to assess model performance.
